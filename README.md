# üß† Intelligent Learning and Decision Making ‚Äì Practical Assignment

## 18/20 ‚≠ê

This repository contains the practical assignment developed for the course Intelligent Learning and Decision Making, part of the 3rd year, 2nd semester of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Minho (academic year 2024/2025).

The work was carried out using KNIME, a powerful data analytics platform that allowed us to build and test machine learning workflows visually. Using KNIME, we explored techniques such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation across different datasets and configurations.

Throughout the project, we deepened our understanding of data analysis, preprocessing, and the role of feature engineering in improving model accuracy. We believe the results achieved reflect a well-executed effort while recognizing opportunities for improvement, such as implementing advanced feature selection or generating new attributes to enhance performance further.
